# Earnest-Money-Deposit-Management


Earnest money deposited by each tenderer to enable the buyer (DRDL) to ensure that a tenderer does not refuse to execute the work if it is awarded to him. It is a guarantee for due performance of the contract. 
Rate of EMD deposit varies from one organization to another. It also varies with value of work. Normally EMD is 2% or 2.5% of estimated cost of tender. 
The earnest money of successful tender can be adjusted against the security deposit required to be furnished by him. 
The earnest money of all the unsuccessful tenders should be returned as early as possible after the award of contract to successful bidder/bidders.
The purpose of this procedure is to define a system for planning and controls of activities relating to monitor the EMD for expiry and to provide alerts to user at least 20 days before the expiry of the EMD and also to record and return the EMD’s to unsuccessful bidders.
Our aim is to design a user interactive application that allows you to manage the EMD given by the vendors. 
The application is designed with special emphasis in the requirements of an organization. 
The actual work of this application starts when the vendors respond, the data of the received quotations is stored in the database. 
Easy access to storing and retrieval of information regarding expiry of various EMD’s of the vendors can be obtained.

Used - Java Server Pages, HTML and MySQL.
