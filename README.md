# Earnest-Money-Deposit-Management


Earnest money deposited by each tenderer to enable the buyer (DRDL) to ensure that a tenderer does not refuse to execute the work if it is awarded to him. It ensures that the contract will be performed as agreed. Organizations differ in the rate at which they deposit their EMDs. Also, it varies with the value of the work. 
EMD is typically 2% or 2.5% of the estimated cost of a tender. If the tender is successful, the earnest money can be applied towards the security deposit in which one is required to provide. All bidders with unsuccessful bids should have the earnest money returned as soon as possible after the contract is awarded to the successful bidder/bidders. 
As part of this procedure, we will define a system for planning and controlling activities relating to monitoring the EMD for expiry, informing the users 20 days before it expires, and by recording and returning the EMD to unsuccessful bidders. 
We aim to develop a user-interactive application that will allow DRDL to manage the EMD given by the vendors. In designing this application, special attention is paid to the requirements of the organization. 
Additionally, the application begins to work after receiving responses from vendors; quotation data is stored in a database. Information about the expiry of various EMDs of vendors can be stored and retrieved easily.
